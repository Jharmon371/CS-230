Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Client wanted to expand there user base by turning their web based application into an app on a phone.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe the part i did well on was making sure i stayed as close to the clients requirements as possible.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Breaking up the design into sections to takle each part seperatly and then again as a whole.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
i would probably change the requirements charts and go into more detail about each OS and Server.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
it is important to consider the users needs while designing because if they cant get it to work then they won't use the application.
